Algorithm/Evolve version 0.01
=============================

This module contains a class-based framework for executing evolutionary
algorithms. The goal is to allow evolution of any type of object conceivable
with relative ease, be it a simple string, an array, a hash of arrays, a 
directed graph object using a CPAN module, or anything else.

The configurable aspects of an evolutionary algorithm can be split up into two 
categories: those aspects closely tied to the object representation (fitness 
function, crossover and mutation operators), and those that do not depend at 
all on the object representation (selection and replacement methods, population
ize, number of mating events). The former group of options is implemented by 
the user and abstracted to class of evolvable objects, while the latter is 
handled by Algorithm::Evolve using simple configuration switches.
