Algorithm/Evolve version 0.03
=============================

This module is intended to be a useful tool for quick and easy implementation
of evolutionary algorithms. It aims to be flexible, yet simple. For this
reason, it is not a comprehensive implementation of all possible evolutionary
algorithm configurations. The flexibility of Perl allows the evolution of
any type of object conceivable: a simple string or array, a deeper structure
like a hash of arrays, or even a complex object like graph object from another
CPAN module, etc. 

It's also worth mentioning that evolutionary algorithms are generally very
CPU-intensive. There are a great deal of calls to C<rand()> and a lot of
associated floating-point math. If you want a lightning-fast framework, then
searching CPAN at all is probably a bad place to start. However, this doesn't
mean that I've ignored efficiency. The fitness function is often the biggest
bottleneck.
